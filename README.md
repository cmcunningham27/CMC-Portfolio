# CMC-Portfolio

## About the Project

&nbsp;

As I work towards becoming a professional Web Developer, I wanted to create an online Portfolio that showcases applications I have worked on up to now. I will continue to add to my Portfolio in my future as there will always be something new to learn.

&nbsp;

This will be important as I begin to apply for a permanent careed in Web Developing. Future employers will need to see the skills I have and how I apply the knowledge I gained in the UW Bootcamp and on my own. 

&nbsp;

To accomplish this I created a website that is responsive to many different sized screens; created internal and external links to information about myself, how to contact me, my resume, LinkedIn, GitHub, and my many projects. During the time it took to create a website I can be proud of, I challenged myself to try new techniques (i.e. changing and icon into a word when hoverd) that gave me a couple "Woohoo!" moments. 

&nbsp;

After I deployed the website, I wanted to see it on my cellphone. Once I did I noticed that my phone's touch-buttons were blocking the bottom icon link on the left side. I then realized that even though it may look right on the Dev Tools, that doesn't mean it will look correct on the actual device. So, that will be something to think about for future applications.
